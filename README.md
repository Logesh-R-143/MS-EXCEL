🍔 <b>Swiggy Funnel Analysis<br>
📖 <b>Overview<br>
Swiggy Funnel Analysis is a project that examines user behavior on the Swiggy platform. By analyzing the funnel (the sequence of steps users take before completing an order), this project identifies where users drop off and provides actionable recommendations to improve the conversion rate.

<b>A typical user journey:

App Visit: User opens the Swiggy app.
Menu View: User browses restaurant menus.
Add to Cart: User selects items to order.
Checkout: User proceeds to the payment screen.
Order Placed: User completes the order.

<b>🎯 Objective
The main goal is to:

Analyze user drop-offs at each stage of the funnel.
Identify patterns in user behavior.
Provide data-driven recommendations to improve Swiggy's order completion rate.
🛠️ Technologies and Tools
This project uses the following tools and technologies:

Python: The programming language for data analysis.
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
numpy: For numerical calculations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization and creating insightful graphs.
📊 Key Insights from the Analysis
Drop-Offs in the Funnel:

Menu View → Add to Cart: Most users leave after viewing the menu but before adding items to their cart.
Add to Cart → Checkout: A significant number of users abandon their carts without proceeding to checkout.
Potential Reasons for Drop-Offs:

Menu page lacks personalized recommendations or offers.
Users may find the prices too high or discover hidden charges (e.g., delivery fees).
Cart abandonment due to a complicated or lengthy checkout process.
Recommendations:

Introduce personalized recommendations on the menu page based on user preferences.
Provide discounts or free delivery for users at risk of abandoning their carts.
Simplify the checkout process by reducing the number of steps.

🌟 Results and Recommendations
Biggest Issue: High drop-off rate between "Menu View" and "Add to Cart".
Proposed Solutions:
Display popular items and customized combos to nudge users to add items to their carts.
Use push notifications for abandoned carts, reminding users of their selections.
